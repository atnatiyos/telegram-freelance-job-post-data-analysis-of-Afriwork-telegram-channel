Title: Telegram Job Scraper and Analyzer

Description:

This project automates the process of scraping job postings from a specific Telegram channel, storing the extracted data in a MySQL database for further analysis. It then performs insightful data analysis to uncover trends and patterns within the job market.

Features:

Data Scraping:
Fetches job postings from a designated Telegram channel.
Extracts relevant job details using regular expressions.
Handles data cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency.


Database Storage:
Saves the extracted job data into a MySQL database for structured storage and efficient retrieval.
Data Analysis:
Analyzes the job data to reveal valuable insights such as:
Distribution of job categories (which categories have the most postings)

Most-demanded job sectors (which sectors have the most openings)
Distribution of required experience levels and gender requirements within each job category and sector
Time series analysis of job postings (monthly trends for different categories and sectors)

Potential Future Enhancements:
Implementing visualization techniques (charts, graphs) to present the data analysis results in a more visually appealing and informative way.
Exploring machine learning algorithms to predict future job trends or identify relevant skills for specific job types.

Installation:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
mysql-connector-python package (for MySQL interaction)
Additional libraries may be required depending on your specific Telegram API implementation and data analysis choices (e.g., pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib or seaborn for visualizations).
Installation:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt file exists
Use code with caution.
Usage:

Execution:
Bash
python Dashboard.py  # Assuming the main script is named main.py
Use code with caution.
Data Analysis Output:

The data analysis results will be displayed in the console or potentially written to a file (depending on your implementation). Consider incorporating visualizations in future enhancements.
